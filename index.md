## Projects 

[Predicting and Evaluating Individual Outcomes and Treatment Benefit from Randomized Trial Data: A Case Study on the Diabetes Prevention Program](/pdf/DPPAnalysisWithIndividualTreatmentEffect.pdf)
<ul>
<li> Developed supervised machine learning pipelines to predict two related outcomes for each individual patient: the probability of diabetes onset and the net-benefit of treatments (metformin or lifestyle intervention). Mediated and oversaw conflict resolution for employee issues using current policies and disciplinary actions. </li>
<li> Built Models with optimized hyperparameter using nested cross validation and evaluated by ROC curve, logloss and calibration plot. </li>
<li> Results indicate that tree based models (Random Forests and their causal extension Causal Forests) outperform simpler linear models (Lasso and Ridge logistic regression). </li>
<li> Made suggested treatment for individual potential diabetes patient based on their physiological measurements, facilitating personalized medicine of clinical trials in Tufts Medical Center. </li>
</ul>

[Design an Interactive Platform for US Cattle Production Visualization and Prediction](/pdf/final_poster.pdf)
<ul>
<li> Build machine learning model with feature selections and time series (ARIMA) model to analyze and predict future cattle productions. </li>
<li> Clean and reformat data(>1GB) using Python Pandas and Numpy. </li>
<li> Visualize data in U.S map, stack bar and line chart using javascrip.D3. </li>
<li> <a href="https://youtu.be/0MQ33xdNRTw"> Video Presentation</a> </li>
</ul>

Sentiment analysis and similarity analysis on President Speech data using Hadoop MapReduce on Google Cloud Platform <!-- (/sample_page) -->
<!-- <img src="images/dummy_thumbnail.jpg?raw=true"/> -->
<ul>
<li> Applied word-count algorithm and compute the sentiment score. </li>
<li> Generated the pairs of N-gram words or characters with the President to compute similarity among Presidents’ speech. Results suggest that Clinton and Obama’s speeches have the highest similarity whereas Reagan and Bush’s speeches share the least similarity. </li>
</ul>

---
Market basket analysis on shopping habits of customers using association rule mining algorithms. – Gatech
<ul>
<li> Clean and reformat customers’ receipts data and generate itemsets for analysis. </li>
<li> Find strong association items by computing key rule strength parameters: support, confidence and lift. </li>
</ul>
